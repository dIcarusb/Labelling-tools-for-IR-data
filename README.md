# Labelling-tools-for-IR-data
### Repository Description:

This repository contains two labelling tools developed for annotating visual and near-infrared (VISNIR) as well as short-wave infrared (SWIR) data. These tools were created for the purpose of spectral clustering analysis belowground, specifically focusing on discriminating root-soil interfaces, grass-herb roots, and living-dead roots within the VISNIR and SWIR regions.

### Features:

-VISNIR Labeling Tool: This tool facilitates the annotation of VISNIR data, aiding in the identification of various belowground components.

-SWIR Labeling Tool: Similarly, this tool is designed for annotating SWIR data.

### Usage:

Researchers can utilize these labelling tools to streamline the process of annotating spectral data, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of analyses conducted in the context of below-ground spectral clustering.
