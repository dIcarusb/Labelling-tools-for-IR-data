# Labelling tools for IR data & SWIR data alignment 
### Repository Description:

This repository contains two labeling tools developed for annotating visual and near-infrared (VISNIR) as well as short-wave infrared (SWIR) data. Additionally, the repository contains a Jupyter notebook with the code for SWIR data alignment used to ensure consistency of the masks for both the March (living) and April (dead) datasets. These tools were created for the purpose of spectral clustering analysis belowground, specifically focusing on discriminating root-soil interfaces, grass-herb roots, and living-dead roots within the VISNIR and SWIR regions.


### Features:

-VISNIR Labeling Tool: This tool facilitates the annotation of VISNIR data, aiding in the identification of various belowground components.

-SWIR Labeling Tool: Similarly, this tool is designed for annotating SWIR data.

-SWIR alignment: the notebook shows the code employed and the results of alignments (images of 1034-1035 nm waveband).

### Usage:

Researchers can utilize these labelling tools to streamline the process of annotating spectral data, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of analyses conducted in the context of below-ground spectral clustering.
